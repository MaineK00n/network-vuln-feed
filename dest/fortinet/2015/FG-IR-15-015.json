  "summary": "",
  "description": "OpenSSL released a security advisory in July 2015 to announce a high severity vulnerability affecting any application that verifies certificates with OpenSSL. In certain conditions, an attacker owning a valid certificate (eg: a certificate for her personal website, signed by legitimate Certification Authorities) could leverage this vulnerability to act as a CA and \"issue\" certificates (in other words: sign forged certificates that would then appear legitimate to a vulnerable peer). OpenSSL notes that this concerns SSL clients (when verifying a server's certificates) but also SSL servers when verifying a client's certificate, in the rarer occurrence of client authentication in the SSL handshake.",
