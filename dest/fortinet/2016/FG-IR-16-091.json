  "title": "Blacknurse ICMP DoS attack",
  "summary": "BlackNurse is a Denial of Service attack consisting in flooding the target with ICMP Type 3 Code 3 packets. The latter type of packets generally consumes more CPU to be processed than the \"traditional\" ICMP packets used in classical ping-flood attacks (Type 8 Code 0). As such, Blacknurse aims at exhausting the target's CPU, rather than its bandwidth (so called \"low-bandwidth attack\").",
