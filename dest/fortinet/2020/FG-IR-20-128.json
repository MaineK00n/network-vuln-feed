  "title": "Multiple Apache Vulnerabilties fixed in 2.4.46",
  "summary": "The Apache project released an advisory on August 7th 2020, which describes the following vulnerabilities:1) CVE-2020-9490 Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via \"H2Push off\" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers. 2) CVE-2020-11984 Apache HTTP server 2.4.32 to 2.4.44 mod_proxy_uwsgi info disclosure and possible RCE. 3) CVE-2020-11993 Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 When trace/debug was enabled for the HTTP/2 module and on certain traffic edge patterns, logging statements were made on the wrong connection, causing concurrent use of memory pools. Configuring the LogLevel of mod_http2 above \"info\" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.",
