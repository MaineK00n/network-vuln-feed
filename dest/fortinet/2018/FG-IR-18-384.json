  "summary": "A path traversal vulnerability in the FortiOS SSL VPN web portal may allow an unauthenticated attacker to download FortiOS system files through specially crafted HTTP resource requests.Fortinet is aware that a malicious actor has disclosed SSL-VPN access information to 87,000 FortiGate SSL-VPN devices. These credentials were obtained from systems which were unpatched against FG-IR-18-384 / CVE-2018-13379 at the time of the actors scan, but may since have been patched but the passwords not reset. Please note that a password reset following upgrade is critical to protecting against this vulnerability, in case credentials have already been compromised.",
